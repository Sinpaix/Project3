Project3 was our third and final Savonia Code Academy 3 project as part of our studies. 
The assignment was to design and develop a Factory Facility Management system with a small team.
Project started with creation of the database and storing the project to cloud environment as it was part of the project requirements.
The finalized Web Application consist of crypted user base, service object management and service auditing tools with change history logging.

Frontend was made with Blazor WebAssembly (C#) and is running in Azure App Service.
Backend was made with .NET WebAPI and Entity Framework (C#) and is also running in Azure App Service.
Database is running in Azure SQL DB.

Database was figured out and edited throughout the project with the whole team.
My part of the project was to make the backend and frontend for the service object management section and the change history log.

I was very happy with the end result and proud of how much I've learned this year. Frontend could have been better looking,
so after the studies I've studied more about UI with Figma to make even better projects in the future.
I really liked working with the .NET WebAPI and Entity Framework, it seems to me it has very usefull tools
and endless possibilities for the future and it was easy to work with. Looking forward to make more projects with that!
